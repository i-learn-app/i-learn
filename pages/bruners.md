# Bruner's

In Bruner's theory, important outcomes include not just the concepts, categories, and problem-solving procedures invented previously by the culture
The features of our app that has been related to this theory are:

##### Definition
> Images that the user can look to know and understand what the topic is all about. (iconic stage)

##### Definition
> A calculator feature in math reviewer so the user can experiment with different numbers and operations but it canâ€™t be used during a quiz. (enactive stage)

##### Definition
> A diagram to represent the percentage of the correct and incorrect answer of the user in the history feature. (iconic stage)

These can be considered as features since bruner's theory has 3 categories
Enactive Stage- Knowledge is stored primarily in the form of motor responses
Iconic stage - Information is stored as sensory images like visual images, icons, or pictures in mind. It explains why we learn different things by using diagrams, visual charts, etc.
Symbolic stage - knowledge is stored primarily as words, mathematical symbols, or in other symbol systems, such as music. For example language, to increase the ability to deal with abstract concepts.
