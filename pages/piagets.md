Having an answer key after taking the quiz that can let users understand what are their mistakes and what could have been done right.
-We included this feature exhibiting Piaget's Theory and Stages of Cognitive Development because with this, we can draw conclusion on how did we answer the quiz incorrectly. According to Piaget, we can understand how things work by drawing conclusion, with that word said, we can have an outcome to begin to understand our own thoughts.

Introducing new material to accommodate new information.
-According to Piaget's stages of cognitive development, there is a stage where we learn how to speak and underestand words, images, and gestures on what someone is trying to convey to us. So we added a feature which is introducing a new material for the users to acquire knowledge by recognizing different topics, and chapters to discover.

Having a reviewer that guides users through sharing the knowledge through the reviewer then the users will be active and engaged by taking a quiz.
-We also added this feature for the users to think outside the box and anticipate the situations what they imagine because according to Piagett, we humans dig deeper about abstract concepts and hypothetical events so we can draw out deductive reasoning after learning the reviewer.

Can choose a different learning style in the reviewer based on the userâ€™s choice.
-The last feature to exhibit Piaget's Theory and Stages of Cognitive Development in our app, is to let users choose a different learning style in the reviewer based on their choice. We added this feature because according to Piaget, we learn how our 5 senses work, so with different learning style they can learn new things by using their senses such as, to hear podcasts, observe images and videos, and etc.
