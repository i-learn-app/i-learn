# Pavlov's (Montaner)
The "Answer" feature implements Pavlov's Classical Conditioning because if the user saw that he got a lot of right answers, then he will automatically assume that he is in the leaderboard. This feature also involves placing a neutral signal before a naturally occurring reflex. This feature involves forming an association between two stimuli resulting in a learned response.
