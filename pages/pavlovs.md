The "One Tap/ Login" feature implements Pavlov's Classical Conditioning because if the system detects the preferred account the user wants to log in, it will automatically log in into this account. This feature also involves placing a neutral signal before a naturally occurring reflex. This feature involves forming an association between two stimuli resulting in a learned response.
